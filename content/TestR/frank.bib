              Traditionally, language learners have relied on dictionaries when trying to read or write in a foreign language. However, new LLM-based chatbots may offer an alternative to traditional dictionaries as lexical tools. This study assesses the effectiveness of ChatGPT versus the monolingual
              Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English
              (LDOCE, 2024) and the bilingual
              Diki.pl
              (Diki.pl, 2024) online dictionaries in supporting English language learners in receptive and productive lexical tasks. With a sample of 166 university students at B2 to C1 proficiency levels and forty uncommon English phrasal verbs, we investigate whether a leading AI-driven chatbot, a high-quality learners’ dictionary, or a popular free bilingual dictionary offers better support in accurately understanding and producing English. The results reveal ChatGPT to be more effective than either dictionary in production, and better than the monolingual dictionary, but not the bilingual dictionary, in reception.},

            This study assesses the effectiveness of ChatGPT versus the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) in supporting English language learners in lexically challenging receptive and productive lexical tasks. With a sample of 223 university students at B2 to C1 proficiency levels, this research investigates whether a leading AI-driven chatbot or a high-quality learners’ dictionary better assists learners in accurately understanding and producing English. The results reveal ChatGPT’s superior performance in both task types. Efficiency, in terms of consultation speed, also favoured ChatGPT, though only in the production task. This study advocates for an integrated approach that leverages both AI, with its interactive and immediate feedback, and more traditional lexicographic tools that may foster learner autonomy and linguistic proficiency.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            This contribution explores the relationship between the English CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) vocabulary levels and user interest in English Wiktionary entries. User interest was operationalized through the number of views of these entries in Wikimedia server logs covering a period of four years (2019–2022). Our findings reveal a significant relationship between CEFR levels and user interest: entries classified at lower CEFR levels tend to attract more views, which suggests a greater user interest in more basic vocabulary. A multiple regression model controlling for other known or potential factors affecting interest: corpus frequency, polysemy, word prevalence, and age of acquisition confirmed that lower CEFR levels attract significantly more views even after taking into account the other predictors. These findings highlight the importance of CEFR levels in predicting which words users are likely to look up, with implications for lexicography and the development of language learning materials.},
